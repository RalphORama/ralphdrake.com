# About Me

Hi. I'm Ralph Drake: jack–of–all–trades, master of some. I've always had a habit of tinkering with computers, now I'm trying to create a career of it.

I absolutely love computer science, and I jump at every opportunity presented to me in the field. I've worked on games, web sites, Google Chrome extensions, and extensive back-end development. Four years ago, I purchased a dedicated server through OVH — I've used it as a resource to teach myself full-stack server management, DevOps, web hosting, and programming.

Since 2010, I've tried to get my hands on as many resources to learn about programming and software development as I possibly could. I've been collecting books and trying to learn as much as I can from them since 2010, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. My current library consists of about fifty books whose topics range from programming languages to server deployment and infrastructure development.

My life isn't 100% computers, however. I love acting, playing bass guitar, and videography. I've worked on many projects in all these fields — I've participated in roughly 20 plays since I was fourteen, I played bass guitar in orchestra and jazz band for three years in high school, and I filmed a few mini-documentaries for class projects.

I'm constantly seeking out ways to merge the arts and computer science, mainly so I can participate in projects that involve two or more of my favorite things at once. Most notably, I created posters, designed programs, and filmed teasers for the Lancaster Country Day School Theatre Company. You can read more about this in the projects section below.
