# About Me

Hi, I'm Ralph Drake: programmer, problem-solver, innovator, ideas man. I'm a 19-year-old college student pursuing a career in film and computer science.

I'm a creator at heart. I've always loved computer science, and have just recently started to pursue my passion in film, thanks in part to my role as a founder, director of photography, and writer for [Norf Entertainment](norf.tv).

I've tinkered with computers for my whole life. I built my first computer in middle school, started learning about server administration so I could host a Minecraft server for my friends, and kept learning as much as I could to solve problems I had. Today, I host a dedicated server that houses several game servers, a few web sites, and every project I've worked on. If you're reading this, you've requested data from it!

I've always loved using computer science to solve problems (check out my [projects](#projects) for some examples). The experience of identifying a problem and building a solution with code is one of my favorite things to do. As of 2018, I'm also pursuing a second passion &mdash; film.

Computer science and the arts are often seen as dichotomous, but I believe the two, when used together, can create much more powerful works of art and science. In high school, I loved creating programs and web sites for the theatre department, jazz band, and even my student government campaign. I'd shoot trailers for the plays, make posters and programs, and get the word out thanks to my firm grasp on technology.

Now, in college, I'm looking for even more opportunities to unite the two. My current, largest project, [Norf Entertainment](https://norf.tv), is one of them. Together with some of my best friends from my previous college, I'm working on producing a first season of an untitled sketch comedy show. I created the website, set up email, and am ready to get into the full swing of production.

In the meantime, I'm still available to work. My previous experience includes a summer internship at the [National Association of Home Builders](https://nahb.org), where I used my knowledge of Python and MARC 21 to transcribe a database of physical assets in two days, rather than the estimated two months.
