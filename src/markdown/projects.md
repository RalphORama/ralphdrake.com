# Projects

## [SamSchindler.com](http://samschindler.com)

### Accomplishments

I created a website for Sam Schindler, a teacher in activist from my hometown Lancaster, PA. He currently uses this site to host his podcast, *What We Will Abide*. He also uses the site to distribute information about *Nora Bear & the Outlaw*, a talk show starring his children, along with his work for Stone Independent, an independent school based in Lancaster, PA.

### Notes

- I created an initial version of this site from scratch using Bootstrap before switching to the current WordPress installation to simplify the content update process for Mr. Schindler.
- Using Wordpress' built in RSS feed generator, Mr. Schindler is able to publish his podcast to iTunes after uploading a new episode to his website.
- Since finalizing the current Wordpress installation, Mr. Schindler has become almost self-sufficient, thanks to the simplicity of the backend.

## Manheim Township CoderDojo

### Accomplishments

I volunteered at the Manheim Township CoderDojo from 2015 to 2016. During my time there, I taught kids aged eight to fourteen how to program JavaScript. This volunteer work was some of the most fun I've had, mostly thanks to how wacky and fun kids that age are.

### Notes

- A lot of the initial learning was self-guided using online programming games like LightBot and services like Codecademy. 
- I still keep up with a few of the kids I mentored while working at the CoderDojo, as they continue to create awesome and interesting projects.
- Some of my supervisors at the Dojo were professionals in the Lancaster tech industry - I made sure to pick their brains for educational and professional opportunities.

## Small Projects

I've worked on quite a few small projects in my time, usually as exercises to learn new programming languages. Here's a few examples of what I've created:

#### [ThreeFiveSeven](https://github.com/RalphORama/ThreeFiveSevenGame)

This game was inspired by two things: the whiteboard version we played in Calculus class, and my desire to learn GUI manipulation in Java. I programmed this game over the course of a week, and submitted it for extra credit in my AP Computer Science class. I'm fairly proud of how it turned out, but I never got any of my math classmates to play it.

#### [Chars that Matter](https://github.com/RalphORama/chars-that-matter)

I first started working on Chars that Matter in an ID Tech Camp session during the summer of 2013. The camp/course was a one-week introduction to C++, which I had a great time participating in. I saved the source code in my Google Drive, and tinkered with it on and off for a few years. 

I decided to come back and finish Chars during my first semester of college as my final project for *Intro to Programming*. I updated the logic to use dynamically allocated arrays, header files, and a library that allowed me to create my levels by reading a JSON file.

#### [Ralph's Cogs](https://github.com/RalphORama/ralphs-cogs)

My friends and I use the popular service [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) to communicate on a daily basis. We have our own 'server,' which includes an instance of [Red DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot), hosted by one of my friends. While I didn't write the bot itself, any user can write a 'cog,' or a plugin that extends the bot's functionality. 

Since I recently became interested in learning Python, I decided a good place to start would be creating some cogs for our instance of the bot. The two cogs I've written so far are still under development, and provide the following functionality:

- **mailgun**: Provides functionality for sending emails from the Discord server via [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/), an email service I'm very fond of.
- **antidupe**: A 'listener' rather than a 'command' - the antidupe module automatically deletes duplicate messages on the Discord server to prevent spam. The code isn't in the public repository yet, but a rough version is available via [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/RalphORama/276bdc3703f44043165e739d34636680)
