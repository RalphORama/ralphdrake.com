## About

This is the code that runs my personal website, [ralphdrake.com](https://ralphdrake.com). It's not deployed there right now, as it's still incomplete.

## Setup

1. Clone the project into any given directory
2. Run `npm install && grunt`
3. Point NGINX or Apache at the `dist` folder

## Roadmap

These are my set deliverables for this project, in order:

- [x] Write filler for 'about me' section
- [x] Create small screen/mobile layouts
- [x] Fix issue #3 or redesign navbar
- [ ] Look into dropping FontAwesome to reduce http requests/load
- [x] Write *actual* copy for 'about' and 'projects' sections
- [x] Push to server and bug test
