## About

This is the code that runs my personal website, https://ralphdrake.com. It's not deployed there right now, as it's still incomplete.

- [ ] Create small screen/mobile layouts
- [ ] Fix issue #3 or redesign navbar
- [ ] Look into dropping FontAwesome to reduce http requests/load
- [ ] Write *actual* copy for 'about' and 'projects' sections
- [ ] Push to server and bug test
