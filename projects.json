        "accomplishments": "Currently on hiatus as I attend college, CoreRP (formerly MonkeyStrikeGaming) was my fledgling gaming community. Originally created for my friends in high school, CoreRP grew to about 100 members between 2012 and 2014. I used CoreRP as a tool for teaching myself full-stack DevOps, as everything was hosted on a dedicated server I purchased from OVH. Over my past several years administrating the server, I've learned many things about security, deploying webservers, configuring microservices, and, most recently, using Docker to containerize gameservers.",
        "notes":
        [
            "Over the server's 6-year lifespan, we've never had a security incident thanks to key-based authentication and code auditing.",
