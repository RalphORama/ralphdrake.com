        "accomplishments": "Currently on hiatus as I attend college, CoreRP (formerly MonkeyStrikeGaming) was my fledgling gaming community. Originally created for my friends in high school, CoreRP grew to about 100 members between 2012 and 2014. I used CoreRP as a tool for teaching myself full-stack DevOps, as everything was hosted on a dedicated server I purchased from OVH. Over my past several years administrating the server, I've learned many things about security, deploying webservers, configuring microservices, and, most recently, using Docker to containerize game servers.",
        "notes":
        [
            "Over the server's lifespan, we've never had a security incident thanks to key-based authentication and code auditing.",
            "Hosting game servers taught me a lot about debugging binaries, using Docker for containerization, shell scripting, and troubleshooting configuration files.",
            "At CoreRP's peak, we had servers for Minecraft, Garry's Mod, Insurgency, and Team Fortress 2.",
            "I still host game servers on the CoreRP server for my friend Otterfiend and his group <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ClassicBonanza\">Classic Bonanza</a>."

        [
            "Some of the main tools we used for teaching were online games like LightBot.",
            "There was a CoderDojo section for older students (like me), but we never did much since the Dojo only met one Tuesday a month.",
            "Some of my superiors at the Dojo were professionals in the Lancaster tech industry â€” I made sure to pick their brains for learning and work opportunities."
